    lyrics : `It wasn't even half as far as I thought it'd be
    It was barely out of town
    Somewhere in between a creek and some evergreens
    She was showin' me around
    I swore I saw a halo
    Hangin' over her head
    I didn't know I needed savin'
    But that's just what she did
    Last night, I went to heaven and back
    And I stayed there for a while
    I danced with an angel 'til the stars went black
    Last night, I went to heaven and back
    She took my hand and I saw the light
    And I hope I'm goin' back tonight (hey)
    There was somethin' 'bout the way that she held me close
    There was magic in her eyes
    Watched her put a little gold on a gravel road
    Turned the water into wine
    Sunday morning's got nothin' on her
    You might not believe it, but I'm pretty sure
    Last night, I went to heaven and back
    And I stayed there for a while
    I danced with an angel 'til the stars went black
    Last night, I went to heaven and back
    She took my hand and I saw the light
    And I hope I'm goin' back tonight (hey)
    I swore I saw a halo
    Hangin' over her head
    I didn't know I needed savin'
    But that's just what she did
    Last night, I went to heaven and back
    And I stayed there for a while
    I danced with an angel 'til the stars went black

        artist: "Dan + Shay",
        lyrics : `Used to dream about buying that bigger house
        Sitting on top of some hill
        Losing sleep about filling my bank account
        Wondering if I ever will
        But the older I get, I just care less and less
        'Bout keeping up with people named Jones
        If you don't fill it up with somebody that you love
        It ain't ever gonna feel like home
        There's always gonna be a higher high
        You could chase for the rest of your life
        Greener grass in the yard next door
        Or a shined up Chevy little newer than yours
        You're never gonna fill an empty cup
        If what you got's still not enough
        The thing about happiness I've found is
        It don't live in bigger houses
        I can hear the kids making little footsteps
        Running down the hallway upstairs
        I can see the dogs playing in the back yard
        Through the kitchen window right there
        Maybe life's kinda more 'bout us swinging on a porch
        Holding her while the sun disappears
        Why would I wanna be anywhere else in the world
        When my whole world is sitting right here?
        There's always gonna be a higher high
        You could chase for the rest of your life
        Greener grass in the yard next door
        Or a shined up Chevy little newer than yours
        You're never gonna fill an empty cup

        You're way too young to end your life, huh

        I need some love to rain on me
        Still, I sit all alone,
        Wishing all my feeling was gone
        Gotta get over you
        Nothing for me to do
        But have one last cry
        One last cry
        Before I leave it all behind
        I've gotta put you out of my mind, this time
        Stop living a lie
        I know I gotta be strong,
        'Cause 'round me life goes on and on and on
        And on
        I'm gonna dry my eyes
        Right after I have my one last cry
        One last cry
        Before I leave it all behind
        I'm gonna put you out of my mind, for the very last time
        Been living a lie
        I guess I'm down
        I guess I'm down
        I guess I'm down to one last cry

        lyrics : `한적한 밤 산책하다 보면
        어김없이 생각나는 얼굴
        반짝이는 별을 모아 그리는 그런 사람
        좁다란 길 향기를 채우는
        가로등 빛 물든 진달래꽃
        이 향기를 그와 함께 맡으면 참 좋겠네
        보고 싶어라 그리운 그 얼굴
        물로 그린 그림처럼 사라지네
        보고 싶어라
        오늘도 그 사람을 떠올리려
        산책을 하네
        대기는 차갑게 감싸고
        생생하게 생각나는 그때
        안타까운 빛나던 시절 뒤로하고 가던
        보고 싶어라 그리운 그 얼굴
        물로 그린 그림처럼 사라지네
        보고 싶어라
        오늘도 그 사람을 떠올리려
        산책을 하네
        따뜻한 손 그리고 그 감촉
        내가 쏙 들어앉아 있던 그 눈동자
        그 마음 아무것도 바라지 않고
        사랑을 주던 그가 보고 싶어지네
        그리운 그 얼굴 물로 그린 그림처럼 사라지네
        보고 싶어라
        오늘도 그 사람을 떠올리려 산책을 하네
        오늘도 산책을 하네
        오늘도 산책을 하네`,

        근데 좀 허전해 난 여전히 거기 있나 봐
        Yeah 후련하게 다 털어내 (다, 다)
        지난 일에 마음 쓰는 게 it's alright
        답이 잘 보이는가 싶다가도
        어느새 날 가두는 감옥이 돼 yeah
        시간은 앞으로만 가는 걸 어째
        그동안 난 아무것도 이룬 것이 없네 yeah
        아직도 내 마음속엔 너 oh, oh
        너를 그리워하다 하루가 다 지났어
        너를 그리워하다 일 년이 가버렸어
        난 그냥 (난 그냥) 그렇게 살아 (그렇게 살아)
        너를 그리워하다, 그리워하다
        다 괜찮을 거라 되뇌어 봐도
        내 하루에 끝엔 또 너로 남아 oh, oh
        너 없인 안 될 것 같던 내가 이렇게 살아
        사실 좀 허전해 넌 여전히 여기 있나 봐
        내 마음은 여전해 (hey) 아직 너를 원해 (원해)
        몇 년이 지나도 난 아직 널 그리워해 (그리워)
        난 아직 기억해 (hey) 우리 처음 봤을 때 (hey)
        네 옷차림과 머리 스타일도 다 정확하게 (I say)
        I pray for you every night and day
        I hope that someday soon I can see you once again, yeah

        수없이 많은 날을 울고 웃었다
        시간이란 건 순간이란 게
        아름답고도 아프구나 (yeah)
        낭만 잃은 시인 거의 시체 같아
        바라고 있어 막연한 보답
        아픔을 피해 또 다른 아픔을 만나
        옆에 있던 행복을 못 찾았을까?
        너를 보내고 얼마나
        나 많이 후회했는지 몰라
        지금 이 순간에도 많은 걸
        놓치고 있는데 말이야
        시간은 또 흘러 여기까지 왔네요
        지금도, 결국 추억으로 남겠죠
        다시 시작하는 게 (시작하는 게) 이젠 두려운걸요

        Yeah, let's learn from our mistakes
        우린 실패로부터 성장해 (성장해)
        사랑은 하고 싶지만 nobody wants to deal
        With the pain that follows, no
        I understand them though
        Yeah, 이해돼, 이해돼 사랑이라는 게
        매일 웃게 하던 게 이제는 매일 괴롭게 해 (괴로워)
        아픈 건 없어지겠지만 상처들은 영원해
